# ethereum-bridge

## Goal
The goal of making a trustless Ethereum bridge is to make a fully Ethereum compatible smart contract hub on Polkadot. Plasm1.0 is a dApps hub on Polkadot but Plasm2.0 will be a multi-chain and  multi-virtual machine smart contract hub powered by Polkadot. In this repo, we create an Ethereum bridge.
